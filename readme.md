# The Uni Framework

Web applications made easy.

NOTE: This framework has been replaced by [Terrace](https://github.com/sandro-pasquali/Terrace). 

Uni is still fully usable, but no longer maintained. [Terrace](https://github.com/sandro-pasquali/Terrace) may be worth a look.

## Features

```
- Declarative syntax.
- Smart data binding.
- Clean MVC file structure.
- Modular, encapsulated UI components.
- Compatible with Jquery/JqueryUI and related plugins.
```
